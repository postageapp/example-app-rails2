= Postage Plugin

Author:: {The Working Group, Inc}[http://www.twg.ca/]
Version:: 1.0.2
Documentation:: http://postageapp.com/docs

== Installation

As with any typical Rails plugin, installation is done with script/plugin:

  % script/plugin install git://github.com/theworkinggroup/postage.git
  
Create the configuration file:

  % rake postage:setup API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY_HERE

This will create a file in RAILS_ROOT/config/initializers/postage.rb that 
will tell ActionMailer to deliver your emails through Postage App and 
which API key you are using.

  Postage.configure do |config|
    config.api_key = 'YOUR_API_KEY_HERE'
  end

To test that the installation succeeded and that the API key is valid, run:

  % rake postage:test

== Usage

<b>Note:</b> To quickly convert your existing mailers make sure that they 
inherit from Postage::Mailer instead of ActionMailer::Base like so:

  class MyNotifier < Postage::Mailer
    def signup_notification(recipient)
      # ...
    end
  end
