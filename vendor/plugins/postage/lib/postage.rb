  # Sends a message to PostageApp service.
  # Accepts following parameters:
  #
  #   :content -- a hash of content with mimetype as a key. Most common use:
  #     { 'text/plain' => 'html message content',
  #       'text/html'  => 'plain text content' }
  #     also takes a hash of attachments:
  #     { 
  #       'attachments' => {
  #         'filename.ext' => {
  #           'content_type'  => 'attachment_content_type',

  #         }
  #       }
  #     }
  #
  #   :template -- should match message template name that you have
  #     defined in your PostageApp account. Think of it as a Rails template
  #     that wraps your message and outputs defined message variables.
  #
  #   :recipients -- A list of emails your message goes to. Could be in several
  #     formats. A string, an array of strings, or hash that defines recipients
  #     as keys and values as a hash of variables that apply to that recipient:
  #     { 'bob@postageapp.com' => {'first_name' => 'Bob'} }
  #
  #   :variables -- A hash of variables that can be applied by the message
  #     template (provided it's available) or message content you send along.
  #     { 'users_registered_so_far' => User.count }
  #
  #   :headers -- A hash of your standard email headers. Example of one you want:
  #     { 'Subject' => 'This is my messge' }
  #
  # Returns Postage::Response object, or nil if request never happened.
